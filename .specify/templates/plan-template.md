# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Code Quality Is Enforced** – Planned work must state how code review, linting/formatting, and documentation updates keep `sqlite-metadata-system.md` + related files coherent; no feature is accepted without explicit ownership of cleanup debt.
- **II. Testing Proves Every Change** – Each user story lists the exact unit, integration, and regression tests that will fail first; the plan documents how CI is run locally plus any fixtures, and flags gaps that need new harnesses.
- **III. Experience Consistency Across Surfaces** – Designs reference the canonical contracts from `sqlite-metadata-system.md` (API), `docs/process.md` (workflow), and published UX/CLI patterns; deviations include a migration note and demo plan.
- **IV. Performance Budgets Are Contracts** – Every new path owns latency, throughput, and resource targets (default: `<200ms p95` write APIs, `<100ms p95` reads, `<256MB` memory, `<5s` CLI batch); the plan specifies instrumentation proving these budgets.
- **V. Spec-Driven Delivery** – Feature scope links back to the living proposal plus any `specs/<feature>` documents; no work begins until acceptance criteria are copy-pasted or referenced so reviewers can trace requirements.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
