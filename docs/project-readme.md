# SQLite Metadata Proposal Board

## Column Flow
1. **Backlog** – Ideas and planned tasks waiting prioritisation.
2. **Selected** – Scoped tasks committed for the current cycle.
3. **In Progress** – Active work items.
4. **Review** – Work awaiting feedback or approval.
5. **Done** – Completed and merged work.

## Automation Rules
- Newly linked issues default to **Backlog**.
- Use the `Stage` single-select field to move cards between columns.
- Keep related issues/PRs linked for traceability.

## Usage Tips
- Every card should reference an issue using the Planning or Research template.
- Update the `Milestone`, `Labels`, and `Assignees` fields directly on the board.
- Archive completed cards regularly to keep the board lean.
